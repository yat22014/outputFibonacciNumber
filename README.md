This repo demonstrates how to find fibonacci number by giving an array of interges.
Fibonacci number of Fn is deﬁned by: Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2, F1 = 1, F2 = 1.
For example: outputFibonacciNumber([1,22,9]) and the output: 2, 34, 13.
Explanation: 2 is the next ﬁbonacci number great than 1. The ﬁbonacci number after 9 is 13, and after 22 is 34
